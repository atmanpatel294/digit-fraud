# MNIST vs USPS using Siamese Networks

As Siamese networks are known to work well even in absence of large amount of data, we can use it to detect forgery with digits in IDs given few examples. Using a subset of 9298 images from both MNIST and USPS, I was able to detect the domain correctly with an accuracy of 88Â±2%.
